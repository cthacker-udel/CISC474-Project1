## Overview

We will be implementing the game Frogger, utilizing a static html page with DOM manipulation via javascript, the javascript file will consist of vanilla JS and jQuery mixed in. We will have multiple team members working on separate parts, to give equal opportunity for all developers to contribute to this project. The project is relatively bare-bones, consisting of only three aspects, the client-side display, which will consist of index.html, and index.js. We may split the files into their unique parts however, such as the scripts to move the frog into frog.js, car physics logic into cars.js, and so on. The assets, which will consist of sprites, music, etc, nothing that will affect the program in a mutative way. Documentation as well, which will be in our codebase, and here as well, to summarize our work, and document the code we have for future readers, and how it works.
